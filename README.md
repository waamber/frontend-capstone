## About
For my frontend capstone I decided to build a geocaching application. I really wanted play with the Google Maps API, so this was a great opportunity to do that.

This application allows you to browse caches hidden by others and yourself. You can hide, find and edit the caches as well. You also have the ability to earn different badges depending on the accomplishment.
